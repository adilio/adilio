### 🧩 About Me

I'm Adil, a sysadmin-turned-solutioneer who believes that curiosity, automation, and caffeine are the holy trinity of productivity.  
I currently work as a **Senior Solutioneer at Palo Alto Networks**, helping organizations modernize their cloud security posture while keeping things practical and fun.  

When I’m not building labs or solving cloud problems, I’m probably creating something weird and wonderful—like games, tools, or interactive demos that make learning security a little less boring.

- ☁️ **Cloud Architecture** — AWS, Azure, and hybrid security patterns
